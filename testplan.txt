Testing of our program was a pretty simple, our plan was to do a series of commands
that will run through every possible error and command we could do for example some
commands will throw the same error so for each command we tested multiple times the
the correct way of invoking it along with incorrect ways to make sure all the errors for
that command worked. We also created a Dummy client that will send malformed messages
for example for put we made it send the wrong length to also test.


Next we finally redid this while having 2 clients connected at the same time
making sure to do things simultaneously in order to assure our server was running to spec.
